# Disclaimer
1. This is one of the few malware repositories on GitHub. Most of these samples are malicious so I highly recommend not using these on your host.
2. If you plan on submitting viewer-made malware, do not submit your in progress malware to VirusTotal, no matter how much you want to see how many AV programs detect your malware. It will likely be picked up by security researchers and a lot of people will know about it.
