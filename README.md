# Malware
This is my collection of malware used in videos. Some of these archives are password protected, so here's the password for them:
1. MrMinor: 200subs
2. おっと (otto): oops
3. modoranai: kowaiyo
# Disclaimer
1. This is one of the few malware repositories on GitHub. Most of these samples are malicious so I highly recommend not using these on your host.
2. If you plan on submitting viewer-made malware, do not submit your in progress malware to VirusTotal, no matter how much you want to see how many AV programs detect your malware. It will likely be picked up by security researchers and a lot of people will know about it.
3. Some of my malware may not be distributed. This is to prevent abuse if a destructive malware is designed for Windows 7 or later.
# Abuse
I strongly condemn abuse of these malicious samples. If you would like to use these samples, do yourself a favor and keep them isolated from others' computers.
